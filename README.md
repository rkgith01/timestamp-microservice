# Timestamp Microservice

This repository contains the boilerplate code for the Timestamp Microservice project, as part of the APIs and Microservices certification on freeCodeCamp.

## Project Overview

The Timestamp Microservice project is a full stack JavaScript application that provides functionality similar to the [example](https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks) provided by freeCodeCamp. The main purpose of this project is to parse and return the Unix timestamp and UTC string of a given date or timestamp.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the server by running `npm start`.
5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified).

## Features

- Parses and returns the Unix timestamp and UTC string of a given date or timestamp.
- Handles various date formats and invalid inputs gracefully.
- Returns the current time if no date parameter is provided.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- HTML
- CSS
